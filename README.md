# React Memory Game - Coding Task

## Objective

Build a simple memory matching game using React. The gameplay should be similar to this example:

Focus on functionality only — no need for animations, sounds, or advanced graphics.

---

## Requirements

1. Create a React app.
2. Implement a **4x4 grid** memory game with **16 cards**:
   - Each card displays a letter (A through H).
   - Each letter appears exactly twice.
   - Cards should be shuffled randomly at the start of each game.
3. Users can flip two cards at a time:
   - If the cards match, they remain visible.
   - If they don’t match, flip them back after a short delay.
4. Track and display:
   - The number of attempts (each time two cards are flipped).
   - The number of successful matches.
5. On page reload or when the user tries to leave the page, display a confirmation prompt:
   > "Are you sure you want to leave?"
6. The game resets and reshuffles on page reload.
7. Deploy the app and provide the public URL.
8. Publish your source code to a public GitHub repository and provide the link.

## Deliverables

- A live deployed app URL.
- A public GitHub repo with your source code.

---

## Time Expectation

Estimated time to complete: **2-3 hours**

---

## Notes

- Keep the UI simple and functional.
- Focus on clean, maintainable React code.
- Use local React state for managing game logic.
- No need for external libraries for animations or sound.
